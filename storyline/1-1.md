  毒师的片头有不少都很有意思，尤其是第一集，看完了之后，<del>每个人都不禁浮现出人生的三个重要问题:我是谁？我在哪？我在干什么？</del>每个人都不禁有三个疑问，他是谁，他在哪，他在干什么？   
  美剧的这种非常有张力的悬念式开头是经常能够看到的，托了好莱坞制作模式的福，不这样搞是很容易被夭折的。让我们自我审查掉制度问题，总之，这种开头模式如果能很好的填坑，就是神剧，如果不能就是烂尾楼了。。。对了，就是说你，超级烂尾楼**LOST**。  
  有了这个开头的悬念，大家才能耐心的看完片头曲不换台，随后，编剧将花一集来解答这个问题。  
  来咱们跟着编剧走一遍剧情。

 伤心三连击，课堂上管不住学生，工作之外还要打工从事容易被知识分子（老白自己）和学生鄙视的体力劳动。

首先，老白的穷卢瑟出场是比较经典的，唯一可比的可能就是【美国丽人】了，那也是我很喜欢的影片。  
另外值得注意的是老白老婆和儿子的对话，可以反映出来一些他老婆bossy的特性，有控制欲，后面的种种对话和剧情将印证这点。  
而老白儿子小白，则表现出来了一定的青春期典型特征。  
小姨子的负能量来自于哪里呢？  
小姨夫自信点和嘴炮能力都加满了，



, who has cerebral palsy. Walt supplements his low teaching salary by working part-time at a local car wash, where he is often humiliated in front of the students he teaches. After being humiliated by a student at the car wash, Walt returns home to a surprise birthday party arranged by Skyler. Shortly after his 50th birthday, Walt collapses at the car wash and is raced to the hospital, where he is told that he has developed inoperable lung cancer and has, at best, two years to live. He opts to keep this news from his family and from Skyler's sister Marie Schrader and her husband Hank, a DEA agent.

After returning to work, Walt has a fit of rage at the car wash and walks off the job. To relieve his tension, Walt — having earlier seen a news report showing a large amount of money recovered from a DEA drug bust — takes up Hank's offer to go on a ride-along as he and his partner Steven Gomez raid a known meth lab. As the DEA agents clear out the house, Walt observes his former student Jesse Pinkman sneaking out a back window. Later, Walt tracks down Jesse's address and blackmails him to helping him produce crystal meth, without revealing why. Walt turns over his life savings to allow Jesse to purchase a Bounder RV to use as a mobile lab, while he steals supplies from the high school chemistry lab needed for the process.

Walt and Jesse drive the RV to a remote desert location and begin to cook. Walt's expertise in chemistry enables them to create crystal meth that Jesse claims is the purest he's ever seen. Jesse offers to take a sample to a local dealer, and drives back into town to meet Krazy-8 Molina. Jesse realizes too late that Krazy-8 is a cousin of Emilio Koyama, his partner that was busted on the earlier raid and now free on bail. Emilio believes Jesse abandoned him, but Jesse promises to prove his loyalty by driving them to the RV to show that he is helping them cook. When they meet Walt, Emilio recognizes him from the raid and thinks that he is an informant, leading him and Krazy-8 to hold the two at gunpoint. Jesse tries to run but trips on a rock and falls, knocking himself out. Walt barters for his life by offering to show them how he produced the meth. As they watch Walt inside the RV, Emilio flicks away a cigarette outside, which causes a brush fire to ignite. Walt uses the distraction to synthesize deadly phosphine gas before he flees the RV, causing Emilio and Krazy-8 to pass out.

Hearing sirens in the distance, Walt quickly dons a gas mask and puts one on Jesse before pulling him into the RV's passenger seat, still filled with phosphine fumes. Walt frantically drives the RV away from the spreading brush fire. As shown in medias res at the start of the episode, Walt drives the RV into a ditch and stumbles out of the vehicle, discarding his gas mask. Believing that he is about to be captured by the police, Walt records a video message to his wife and son before trying to shoot himself with a pistol, unaware the safety is still on. As the sirens near, Walt is relieved to find they are only fire engines responding to the brush fire, and quickly hides his weapon. Jesse wakes up and joins Walt as they watch the fire engines race by. The two manage to extract the RV from the ditch and drive back into town, making sure Emilio and Krazy-8 are secured in the RV before leaving it at Jesse's home. Later that night, Walt returns home and meets his wife's troubled queries with a new sexual vigor, which leaves her asking, "Walt, is that you?"
